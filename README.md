3x3 9 cell FPGA implementation In Verilog HDL
This is a very naive FPGA implementation in verlog HDL.This FPGA utilises 4 input LUT and 5bit channel width.
Using thses 9 cells any combinational or sequential circuit can be implemented. As of now i have implemented a 4 bit Full adder and this circuit utilises 8 Logic blocks of the FPGA.
An array of FPGA is also possible by connecting together multiple units to implement complex boolean functions.
